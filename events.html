    <p class="subtitle">The most discussed cases in the GCP's history — moments where the network showed its strongest deviations. Each has been the subject of formal analysis and ongoing debate.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="prose" style="margin-bottom:32px">
    <p>The GCP has formally tested over 500 events since 1998. Most show small or no deviations from randomness. But a handful produced results that are difficult to dismiss — and equally difficult to explain. These are the events that made the GCP famous, and the ones that keep the debate alive.</p>

      <h3>September 11 Attacks</h3>
      <p>The most studied and most debated event in GCP history. The network showed statistically significant deviations during the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon — one of the strongest signals ever recorded across the entire EGG network.</p>
      <p>What makes this case uniquely controversial is the claim that <strong>deviations appeared to begin several hours before the first plane struck</strong>. The cumulative deviation curve shows an upward trend starting in the early morning hours, well before the attacks at 8:46 AM Eastern.</p>
      <p>Proponents argue this suggests a form of collective precognition or non-local consciousness effect. Critics point out that the analysis window was defined after the fact, and that in any continuous dataset, you can find apparent precursor patterns by chance if you select the right window. An independent analysis published in <em>Foundations of Physics Letters</em> confirmed the statistical significance but noted the interpretation remains open.</p>
      <p class="event-note">This event was formally registered for analysis on September 11, 2001, with a defined analysis window of 10:00-22:00 UTC. The "precursor" claims are based on exploratory analysis outside this formal window.</p>

      <h3>Indian Ocean Tsunami</h3>
      <p>A magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered devastating tsunami waves across the Indian Ocean, killing over 230,000 people in 14 countries — one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.</p>
      <p>The GCP data showed elevated coherence around the time of the earthquake itself — <strong>before the scale of the disaster was understood by most of the world</strong>. The earthquake struck at 00:58 UTC, but the tsunami wouldn't reach most affected coastlines for hours, and global news coverage took longer still.</p>
      <p>This timing raises an interesting question: if the GCP effect depends on mass human awareness, how could the network respond before most people knew the disaster was happening? Possible explanations include the effect being triggered by the physical event itself rather than human awareness, the response coming from affected populations near the epicenter, or simple coincidence.</p>

      <p>The GCP network showed elevated deviation during and after the attacks. The signal was less dramatic than 9/11 but statistically notable, fitting the general pattern of terrorism events producing above-average deviations.</p>

      <p>The largest coordinated celebration in human history. As midnight swept across time zones, billions of people celebrated simultaneously in rolling waves around the planet.</p>
      <p>The GCP data for this event showed a <strong>distinctive rolling pattern</strong> — coherence rising and falling in a way that loosely tracked the progression of midnight across time zones. This pattern has been observed in subsequent New Year's analyses as well, suggesting it may be a genuine characteristic of globally synchronized celebrations.</p>
      <p>New Year's celebrations are among the most consistently tested events in the GCP database, providing a kind of annual replication experiment.</p>

      <h3>Princess Diana's Funeral</h3>
      <p>One of the earliest events analyzed by the GCP — and one that helped justify building the permanent network. An estimated 2.5 billion people watched Diana's funeral service at Westminster Abbey, making it one of the most-watched broadcasts in television history.</p>
      <p>The data from a preliminary network of 14 random event generators showed significant deviation during the ceremony. This result, together with findings from the Gaiamind meditation months earlier, provided the evidence that convinced researchers to build the full worldwide EGG network.</p>

      <p>Elections are among the events the GCP has tested repeatedly. Results vary — some elections show clear deviations, others don't. This inconsistency is used by both supporters and critics to support their respective positions.</p>

    <h2>A Note on Interpretation</h2>
    <p>It's important to emphasize that these Z-scores and sigma values, while statistically notable, don't prove causation. A Z-score of 3.14 means the deviation is unlikely to occur by chance alone — but "unlikely" doesn't mean "impossible," and the selection of events for analysis introduces complexity. The GCP's formal testing protocol requires pre-registration of events and analysis parameters, but the broader question of <em>which</em> events get tested remains a point of legitimate debate.</p>
